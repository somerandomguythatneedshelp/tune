[00:30.33]I know that you're hiding something from me
[00:34.09]That's been close to your heart
[00:37.46]And I felt it creeping up everyday
[00:41.27]Baby, right from the start
[00:42.99]I know that look you give when we're fighting
[00:47.45]We're fighting
[00:49.98]'Cause I used to be the one who was lying, oh lying
[00:56.31]Oh, is there someone else or not?
[01:01.46]'Cause I wanna keep you close
[01:04.71]I don't wanna lose my spot
[01:08.58]'Cause I need to know
[01:10.28]If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
[01:13.86]If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
[01:19.06]Is there someone else or not?
[01:22.81]Ooh, or not
[01:27.31]I don't deserve someone loyal to me
[01:31.01]Don't you think I see?
[01:34.03]And I don't want to be a prisoner to who I used to be
[01:39.85]I swear I changed my ways for the better, the better
[01:46.76]'Cause I wanna be with you forever, forever
[01:53.28]Oh, is there someone else or not?
[01:58.33]'Cause I wanna keep you close
[02:01.59]I don't wanna lose my spot
[02:05.41]'Cause I need to know
[02:07.27]If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
[02:10.86]If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
[02:15.89]Is there someone else or not?
[02:19.85]Ooh, or not
