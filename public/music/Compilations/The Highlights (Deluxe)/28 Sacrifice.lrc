[00:07.42]I was born in a city
[00:11.67]Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
[00:15.27]So this life's always with me
[00:19.64]The ice inside my veins will never bleed
[00:30.92]Every time you try to fix me
[00:35.35]I know you'll never find that missing piece
[00:38.72]When you cry and say you miss me
[00:43.13]I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but
[00:47.31]I sacrificed
[00:49.79]Your love for more of the night
[00:54.07]I try to put up a fight
[00:57.76]Can't tie me down
[01:02.10]I don't want to sacrifice
[01:06.03]For your love
[01:08.41]I try
[01:09.98]I don't want to sacrifice
[01:13.91]But I love my time
[01:26.21]I hold you through the toughest parts when you feel like it's the end
[01:30.26]'Cause life is still worth living
[01:32.20]Yeah, this life is still worth living
[01:34.24]I can break you down and pick you up
[01:36.15]And fuck like we are friends
[01:38.02]But don't be catching feelings
[01:39.93]Don't be out here catching feelings, 'cause
[01:42.45]I sacrificed
[01:44.96]Your love for more of the night
[01:49.03]I try to put up a fight
[01:52.74]Can't tie me down
[01:57.06]I don't want to sacrifice
[02:01.09]For your love
[02:03.60]I try
[02:04.82]I don't want to sacrifice
[02:08.92]But I love my time
[02:12.81]I don't want to sacrifice
[02:16.76]For your love
[02:19.15]I try
[02:20.47]I don't want to sacrifice
[02:24.62]But I love my time
[02:30.11]Oh, baby
[02:32.20]I hope you know that I, I tried
[02:37.65]Oh, baby
[02:40.06]I hope you know I love
[02:42.84]My time
[02:45.80]I don't want to sacrifice
[02:49.62]I don't want to
[02:50.64]I try
[02:53.67]I don't want to sacrifice
[02:57.40]But I love my time
